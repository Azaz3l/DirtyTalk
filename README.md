## **<p>Writing your own lines:<br>**
Contributions to dialog are welcome and greatly appreciated, especially considering my lack of writing skill.<br>
Go here: https://github.com/jptrrs/SpeakUp/wiki<br>
Aside from that, you should be able to gather anything you need to know to write your own lines just by looking at the included xmls.</p>

### **<p>Submitting lines:<br>**
Send me a text file nicely formated with your lines and I'll review/add them.<br>
**Here's an example of what I would like your text document to look like:</p>**

  ```
  Rape.xml
  <!-- ===AnalRape=== -->
  <li>rape_m->I'm gonna put my peen up that behind!</li>

  RapeReply.xml
  <!-- ===AnalRape=== -->
  <li>rape_react_m->Oh my, there be a peen in my behind!</li>
  <li>masochist_m->I sure do enjoy your peen being forced in my behind, [rapist_m]!</li>

  <!-- ===VaginalRape=== -->
  <li>rape_react_m->Oh my, there be a peen in my [vagina]!</li>
  ```
<p>You can put as many or as few lines as you'd like, just keep them in one text file, then send it to me on LL here: https://www.loverslab.com/profile/2517846-azaz3l/</p>
